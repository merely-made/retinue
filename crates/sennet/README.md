# sennet

An independent, permissively licensed mesh radio protocol implementation in
the [retinue](https://github.com/merely-made/retinue) family, targeting
interoperability with existing LoRa messaging meshes, on the shared
[tulle](https://github.com/merely-made/retinue) radio layer.

Sennet is an independent implementation, developed from wire observation and
public documentation. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by any existing
mesh project.

A sennet is a ceremonial fanfare for a procession.

**Status:** the client serial deframer, schema-free protobuf reader, direct
capture fixtures, LoRa transport header/AES-128/256-CTR layer, application
envelope, port-1 UTF-8 text path, node-number/name reader, caller-persisted
source/packet-ID allocator, and bounded managed-flood relay core are
implemented. The node-info reader maps the observed numeric lookup key to user
ID, long name, and short name. Its field assignments are regression-tested
against two one-variable changes captured from stock firmware. `NodeDirectory`
retains those records and resolves a received packet into source, destination,
and text without hiding unknown endpoints. The relay filters one configured
channel, deduplicates `(source, packet_id)`, preserves ciphertext and nonce
identity, and returns a configurable delay window to its caller. A Sennet text
packet built through that API was transmitted by Tulle direct-PHY firmware on
COM6, accepted and rebroadcast by a stock node on COM7, and returned through
COM7's client API. The exact RF packet and client receipt are regression
fixtures. The direct-PHY implementation has also passed encrypted text in both
directions between a Heltec v4 on COM6 and the independent T114 firmware on
COM10.

With the `hardware` feature, `direct_phy_text` drives that same path through
Tulle's reusable Rust serial link. It advances and flushes a versioned packet-ID
state file before transmitting. The protocol layer constructs and opens
packets; Tulle owns USB framing, pacing, and radio metrics.

`direct_phy_pair` is the two-independent-radio headed receipt:

```text
cargo run --features hardware --example direct_phy_pair -- COM6 COM10 LEFT_STATE RIGHT_STATE
```

Reconstruction follows controlled radio-bench experiments, with raw captures
and the scope of each claim recorded in [`PROVENANCE.md`](PROVENANCE.md).
Unexplored fields remain numbered rather than acquiring speculative names.

The source crates remain MIT/Apache-2.0. Downstream combined firmware may be
distributed under GPLv3 with its corresponding source and required notices;
GPL-derived implementation code does not enter the permissive crate graph.

This is a deliberate choice. Sennet is an independent implementation, built
clean-room (see [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md)) — it contains no third-party
protocol code and needs no one's permission to exist. But a *permissive*
independent implementation would be an easy route around the copyleft the
protocol's own authors chose, letting anyone take the work without giving
improvements back. MPL-2.0 keeps that door shut: build whatever you like on top,
under any license, but improvements to *this implementation* stay published.

MPL is GPL-compatible, so it also combines into the GPLv3 firmware images this
project ships.

//! A duty-cycle-respecting radio link: a [`Modem`] behind the shared airtime gate.
//!
//! The [`Modem`] trait puts frames on the air and the [`AirtimeBudget`](crate::airtime) tracks
//! how much air a channel may use; this joins them. Every transmission is priced by its
//! time-on-air and charged against the budget, so a caller cannot exceed the regional duty
//! cycle no matter how fast it feeds frames — the finding from the first reliable link over
//! real RF, where an unpaced pump backed the radio's queue up and starved the half-duplex
//! receive windows. The link is sans-io: the caller supplies the clock and drives it, so it
//! runs on a virtual clock in tests exactly as it will over a serial pump.

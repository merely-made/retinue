//! Tulle: the shared radio interface layer for LoRa mesh stacks.
//!
//! Tulle is the seam between protocol stacks and radio hardware: RNode serial
//! control, direct-PHY USB packets, and medium access shared by every protocol
//! on the same radio. It sits beneath
//! [retinue](https://github.com/merely-made/retinue) and its mesh interop siblings,
//! tucket and sennet.
//!
//! A tulle is a fine net fabric: the material every protocol is woven across.

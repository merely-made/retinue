//! retinue — an endpoint-scoped implementation of the
//! [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/) protocol.
//!
//! A retinue is the company that travels with a person. This crate is that for a peer: the
//! identity, announce, link, resource, and reliable-stream layers a node needs to *be* a
//! Reticulum endpoint, embedded as a library, wire-compatible with RNS 1.3.x.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! The wire vocabulary, links, resources, request/response, the endpoint runtime, opt-in
//! transport-node routing, and reliable streaming are all implemented and checked
//! byte-for-byte against a black-box RNS oracle (pinned at 1.4.0; the committed fixtures
//! retain their observed 1.3.8 provenance; see *Provenance*). The
//! layering:
//!
//! - **Sans-io core** — always available, no runtime or RNG: the packet codec
//!   ([`packet`]), identities ([`identity`]), announces ([`announce`]), the token
//!   ([`token`]), HDLC framing ([`iface::hdlc`]), links ([`link`]), resources
//!   ([`resource`]), and the `Channel`/`Buffer` + link-proof reliability machinery
//!   ([`channel`], [`reliable`]). Pure functions over bytes, replayable against fixtures.
//! - **The tokio shell** — behind the `tokio` feature (on by default): the TCP interface
//!   ([`iface::tcp`]) and the [`endpoint`] runtime that attaches interfaces, routes packets,
//!   and opens/accepts links as streams. Turn the feature off and the sans-io core stands
//!   alone.
//!
//! Transport-node routing is opt-in ([`endpoint::Endpoint::enable_routing`], or a full
//! [`endpoint::RoutingPolicy`]); the default posture is endpoint-scoped. On-air interfaces
//! (RNode serial, direct PHY) live in the sibling `tulle` crate and are proven over real
//! RF; endpoint-level resource sessions, route expiry, and announce budgeting are
//! implemented. Ratcheted single packets use caller-owned rotation and retained-key state.
//! IFAC virtual-network authentication is applied at each carrier boundary,
//! including TCP and Tulle. See the README's *Maturity* section and
//! `design_docs/`.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Wire-compatibility target is RNS 1.3.8. This crate was implemented from the
//! public-domain Reticulum protocol specification and the MIT-licensed Beechat
//! `reticulum` crate. The Python reference implementation was never read: it is used
//! strictly as a black-box interoperability oracle, run and observed, and the bytes it
//! emitted are checked in as fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`. See
//! `design_docs/2026-07-13_rns_wire_format_reference.md`.

//! Interfaces: how packets get onto a wire.
//!
//! An interface is a byte pipe plus a framing. R1 implements the TCP interface, which is
//! HDLC framing over a TCP stream, in both the client and the server direction.
//!
//! The framing (`hdlc`) is sans-io and needs only the `alloc` feature. The TCP interface
//! (`tcp`) needs a runtime and sits behind the `tokio` feature, which is on by default.

#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]
pub mod hdlc;

#[cfg(feature = "tokio")]
pub mod tcp;

#[cfg(feature = "tulle-radio")]
pub mod tulle;

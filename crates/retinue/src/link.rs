//! Link primitives: the mode/MTU trailer, and the link id.
//!
//! This is not yet a link implementation (that is R3). It is the two facts that a link
//! implementation cannot be written without, both of which were settled by capturing a
//! real handshake, because a wrong guess on either means no link ever completes and there
//! is no useful error to debug.
//!
//! # The trailer
//!
//! An RNS 1.x link request carries **67** bytes, not 64: the two ephemeral public keys and
//! then a 3-byte trailer. A link proof carries **99**, not 96: signature, public key, and
//! the same trailer. The trailer is a 24-bit big-endian field:
//!
//! ```text
//! bits 23..21  the AES mode   (0 = AES-128-CBC, 1 = AES-256-CBC)
//! bits 20..0   the MTU
//! ```
//!
//! Observed: an initiator sends `20 20 00` = mode 1, MTU 8192. The responder answers
//! `20 01 f4` = mode 1, MTU 500, which is exactly `Reticulum.MTU`. So this is an MTU
//! negotiation, and the mode is AES-256 on both sides.
//!
//! Beechat sends a bare 64-byte request and does not participate in any of this.
//!
//! # The link id
//!
//! The link id is a truncated hash over the link request, and the details are unobvious:
//!
//! ```text
//! link_id = trunc16(SHA256( (flags & 0x0F) || destination(16) || context(1) || payload[..64] ))
//! ```
//!
//! Two things to note. `hops` is excluded, which makes sense: it mutates in transit. And
//! the payload is **truncated to the 64 bytes of keys**, so the trailer deliberately does
//! not affect the link id, which is also sensible because the trailer is negotiable.
//!
//! Derived by solving against two independently captured (request, link id) pairs; only
//! this formula satisfies both. See `oracle/capture_link.py`.

// Needed by the test build or the tokio shell; the bare no_std lib does not reach it.

//! The endpoint runtime: the tokio shell that turns the R0–R4 primitives into a working
//! peer.
//!
//! An [`Endpoint`] holds an identity, an [`AddressBook`], and any number of **interfaces**
//! (TCP connections, dialed or accepted). A background router reads packets from every
//! interface, tagged with the interface they arrived on, and dispatches them: announces
//! populate the address book, inbound link requests are proved and surfaced as connections,
//! and link data is routed to the [`LinkStream`] for its link. Announces are broadcast on
//! every interface; a link's traffic goes back out the interface it came in on. Links are
//! exposed as [`LinkStream`]s (`AsyncRead` + `AsyncWrite`), an ordinary bidirectional byte
//! stream.
//!
//! Multiple interfaces are the substrate for routing (a node that forwards between them) and
//! for a host transport reaching many peers. This is the seam a host implements its own
//! transport trait against; see the crate root.

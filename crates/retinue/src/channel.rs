//! A reliable, in-order message layer over a link — RNS `Channel`, wire-compatible.
//!
//! Raw link data packets are best-effort by spec: over TCP they never drop, so an
//! `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` link is reliable *by accident of the medium*. Over LoRa
//! or serial they drop, reorder, and delay, and a stream that returns `Ok` for bytes
//! that never arrive is lying to its caller. This is the layer that makes the stream
//! honest on any medium: sequence numbers, a send window, retransmission of unproven
//! packets, and receiver-side reordering.
//!
//! The wire is RNS 1.3.8's, captured black-box (see
//! `design_docs/2026-07-13_rns_wire_format_reference.md` §3.9, fixtures
//! `channel_wire.json` / `channel_link.json`):
//!
//! - A message is an [`Envelope`] — `[msgtype u16][sequence u16][length u16][payload]`,
//!   big-endian — carried in a link data packet with context `14` (`0x0e`).
//! - The sequence is windowed **16-bit** (mod [`SEQ_MODULUS`]).
//! - **Acknowledgement is the link packet proof, not an ack message.** Each envelope
//!   packet is proof-requesting; an unproven sequence is retransmitted. Confirmed by
//!   capture: RNS resent a seq-0 envelope 5 times while the receiver stayed silent.
//!
//! It is **sans-io**: [`Channel`] holds no sockets and no clock. The caller (a link
//! driver) drives it — [`poll_transmit`](Channel::poll_transmit) with the current
//! time yields the envelopes to put on the wire (new data within the window, plus
//! retransmits past their timeout); [`handle`](Channel::handle) feeds received
//! envelopes back in; and [`on_proof`](Channel::on_proof) releases an outstanding
//! sequence when its packet's proof arrives (the driver maps proof-by-packet-hash to
//! sequence). That is exactly what makes the retransmit and reorder paths testable
//! against a deterministic loss model on a virtual clock (see `retinue::lossy`).

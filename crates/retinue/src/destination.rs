//! Destination names and their hashes.
//!
//! A destination is named by an app name and a list of aspects. They join with `.` into an
//! *expanded name*, e.g. `("retinue", ["test"])` becomes `retinue.test`. Two hashes fall
//! out of it, and they are not interchangeable:
//!
//! ```text
//! name_hash        = trunc10(SHA256(expanded_name))
//! destination_hash = trunc16(SHA256(name_hash || identity_hash))
//! ```
//!
//! Note the second is a hash of two hashes, and that the identity participates only
//! through its own hash. Verified against RNS 1.3.8: the fixture vector reproduces
//! `example_utilities.announcesample.fruits` as `2419dca3c93718497b91990373df1503`.

// Needed by the test build or the tokio shell; the bare no_std lib does not reach it.
